Open in RStudio: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/advocacy-policy-analysis/pa-dw-yes-opaque-link/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Go straight to the Shiny app: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://petez.shinyapps.io/pa-dw-yes-opaque/)

This repository and its accompanying dynamic document and Shiny app are
three key components of the Institute for Deworming's study on the costs and
benefits of mass deworming interventions in various settings. Together,
these materials create a transparent and reproducible analysis to
facilitate collaboration and discussion about deworming policy.

1 - [An interactive plot](https://petez.shinyapps.io/pa-dw-yes-opaque/), which summarizes the interactions between all key parameters for a given set of assumptions. Materials can be found in: [`code/shiny_app`](https://github.com/advocacy-policy-analysis/pa-dw-yes-opaque-link/tree/master/code/shiny_app).

2 - Open policy report in the form of a [dynamic document](https://advocacy-policy-analysis.github.io/pa-dw-yes-opaque-link/), which details all data, code, and assumptions included in the analysis. Materials can be found in: [`code/dynamic_doc`](https://github.com/advocacy-policy-analysis/pa-dw-yes-opaque-link/blob/master/code/01_final_opa.Rmd).

3 - This Github repository, which stores all data, code, and materials necessary to replicate the analysis in full with minimal effort.
